Okay people let's do this one last time...

My name is... oh nevermind! This is some code! It does a lot of things!

One thing it does is create a website using HTML and CSS.
Another thing it is supposed to do is inventory check specific websites for the respective products you see on the webpage
However when you, you lucky person you, gets around to running this code to test it... IT MIGHT NOT WORK :(((((((
The reason being is that website devs love to update their HTML code rather frequently 
Therefore, the XPATH addresses that we used to test to see whether or not the product is in stock could be altered creating a major bug in the code
There is only one work around that we are aware of that fixes this issue. Updating and monitoring the website manually.
Naturally you can make an AI that does it for you but if something does change you still need to fix it yourself

SO to counteract this, we will provide documentation of the products that we have selected being either in stock or out of stock and manually update the website accordingly
You can find the screenshots under the file labeled "Documentation"
IF all is rainbows and sunshine then when you go to run it everything should be A-OK. but if not, you have the documentation to look at to prove it works

Accoding to our knowledge, this project is working as intended so we hope it is because we'd be sad if it isn't

If you made it to the end of this read me, I just wanted to say thank you for reading. Have a cookie for being a good Software Developer and actually reading someone's README documentation
BECAUSE OUR TEAM DOESN'T :) 

Another note is that we am unaware if you need Node.js or Puppeteer to have this code to work, but if you do here are the steps
If you're using VS code open a bash terminal
type the command---> npm init -y
then type the command ---> npm install puppeteer
That's everything we did in order to get the code to work. Hope that helps
